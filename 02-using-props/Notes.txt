Splitting Components By Feature & State:

each <section> in the App() component is a "feature".

putting different features into different component is better practice in React projects.

in this app, countries and infos are the two sections/features.

--> then we have a lean and clearer code for the bigger projects! 

also in the "infos" components there are some tabs which are reused!
