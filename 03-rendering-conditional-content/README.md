This is a small practice project in which I used a **React Hook (useState)**. The code renders **conditional content** with the help of useState.

**React Hooks** are functions that enable functional components to have state and lifecycle features, which were previously only available in class components. They provide a more straightforward and concise way to manage state and side effects in functional components. The most commonly used React Hooks are **useState**, **useEffect**, **useContext**, and **useReducer**.
